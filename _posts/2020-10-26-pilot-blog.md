The First Step:

My name is Brandon Halley, and welcome to my blog. This blog will consist of future projects I intend to work on as self-professional development and research. I want this blog to serve as a flight recorder of the things I work on outside of my work, and to practice my technical writing skills.

I want this blog to capture the process and the learning curve of entering this industry, and hope that it could guide someone in the right direction with their career. I am well aware that being in cybersecurity is not easy, and you will be a student for life, and I want this blog to capture the workflow of someone trying to make it big.

I am really excited to finally start a blog, and I hope you all are as well.
