Some information about you!

### More Information

Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m a junior network engineer, and a cybersecurity student from South Carolina.

The goal of this site is to serve as a notepad of various projects I work on, and as a record of how I progressed through the learning curve of working in this industry. This blog will serve as flight recorder of the projects I work on, and a personal playground for me to improve my 
technical writing skills. The blog content will include, but are not limited to:

* Programming
* Cloud (GCP, AWS, Azure)
* Network Traffic Analysis
* HackTheBox/TryHackMe WriteUps
* Current Events
* Miscellaneous hobbies

I hope that the content on this blog is interesting for you all. I am open to any feedback, so please do not be shy!
